TylerDactyl is the name of my Keyboard.

I am not a programmer.  This is my repository for a custom Dactyl Manuform that is being built by SKREE.

I am learning about custom firmware and GitHub all at the same time.  Any help or advice is appreciated.

The keyboard will have bluetooth capability and has an embedded trackball in the right side and all of the mouse controls are on the left thumb cluster.

I don't know if any of this is correct or will work, but this is my first attempt.

I will update the README as things progress.



I designed the keyboard with Cosmos Keyboard Generator. Thank you ryanis.cool

skree.us will be printing and assembling the keyboard for me.

The keymap layout is a modified version of the MIRYOKU layout.  I made some changes because I have more keys available and to suit my work flow.  I am a Quality Control Manager for major construction projects and work with construction drawings in BlueBeam Revu quite a lot.  I also manage our database of drawings and materials as construction progresses.

I designed the keymap layout with the help of https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/

Thank you Nick.

As the keyboard build progresses, SKREE, will update me with the actual keymaps from the firmware he compiles, as of now, I built the .json with https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-layout-tools/  Again, Thank you Nick.
