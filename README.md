I am not a programmer.  This is my repository for a custom Dactyl Manuform that is being built by SKREE.

I am learning about custom firmware and GitHub all at the same time.  Any help or advice is appreciated.

The keyboard will have bluetooth capability and has an embedded trackball in the right side and all of the mouse controls are on the left thumb cluster.

I don't know if any of this is correct or will work, but this is my first attempt.

I will update the README as things progress.
